# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
For this project I was given starter code containing HTML, CSS, and base JavaScript. My goal was to make a password generator that randomly puts together characters that are chosen by the user. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This page can be used by anyone to generate a completely random password. 

## Credits 
I took the starter code from the friendly-parakeet repo in Xandromus' GitHub account.

## License
Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.
